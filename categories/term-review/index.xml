      <description>Intro Fall 2022 has been quite a rough ride as it&amp;rsquo;s my first time taking 4 CMPT courses. There were some moments where I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the time to revise some content, but overall, this term was pretty good.
Courses CMPT 300 - Operating Systems I (Hazra Imran) Course Experience: 4/5 Pros: Interesting assignments, decent lectures (recorded), and finish-for-marks class exercises Cons: The exam is quite tricky and assignment requirements might not be detailed enough.</description>

      <title>Term Review - Summer 2022</title>

      <description>Intro Term Review is an every-4-month journal to share all my thoughts and experiences during the finished term. It acts as both my journal and course review (for those who are planning to take similar courses). Experience is given out on a scale of 5 and it is not reflective of the marks that I got, rather it is more about how I felt whether the course was useful for my learning.</description>
