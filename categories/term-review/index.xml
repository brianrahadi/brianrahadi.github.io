      <description>Intro Term Review is an every-4-month journal to share all my thoughts and experiences during the finished term. It acts as both my journal and course review (for those who are planning to take similar courses). Experience is given out on a scale of 5 and it is not reflective of the marks that I got, rather it is more about how I felt whether the course was useful for my learning.</description>
