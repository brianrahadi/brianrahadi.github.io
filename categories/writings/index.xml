      <description>In my transition period from junior high to high school years, I used to be paid to write. Sounds cool at first, until I told everyone that I am just writing for a game guide.
Looking back, I regret that I did not write as much again. Aside from the good money that I got from writing the blog posts, I got to know more about the game mechanics. Writing has helped me to refine my understanding of the game, allowing me to become a better player.</description>
