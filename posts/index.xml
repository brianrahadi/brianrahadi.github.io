      <description>Note: This post has the same content from this sfuia blog. I cross-post it as I was the writer and want to provide more content to my personal website. Hope you enjoy it!

      <description>Intro Fall 2022 has been quite a rough ride as it&amp;rsquo;s my first time taking 4 CMPT courses. There were some moments where I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the time to revise some content, but overall, this term was pretty good.
Courses CMPT 300 - Operating Systems I (Hazra Imran) Course Experience: 4/5 Pros: Interesting assignments, decent lectures (recorded), and finish-for-marks class exercises Cons: The exam is quite tricky and assignment requirements might not be detailed enough.</description>

      <description>Intro Term Review is an every-4-month journal to share all my thoughts and experiences during the finished term. It acts as both my journal and course review (for those who are planning to take similar courses). Experience is given out on a scale of 5 and it is not reflective of the marks that I got, rather it is more about how I felt whether the course was useful for my learning.</description>

      <description>In my transition period from junior high to high school years, I used to be paid to write. Sounds cool at first, until I told everyone that I am just writing for a game guide.
Looking back, I regret that I did not write as much again. Aside from the good money that I got from writing the blog posts, I got to know more about the game mechanics. Writing has helped me to refine my understanding of the game, allowing me to become a better player.</description>

      <description>Self-help advice which tells you to become the person you want to be only reinforces the idea that you are not that thing Pursuing something only reinforces that you lack it in the first place. Everyone wants you to believe that the secret to a good life is to have a nicer job or a better car or a prettier girlfriend. The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.</description>

      <description>Building Wealth Understand How Wealth Is Created It’s not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work.
Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.&amp;rdquo;
 What is Deep Work? “Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”
Types of Deep Work
 Monastic → Full deep work, Bimodal → Seasonal deep Work, Journalistic → Anytime deep work The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling → The easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to make it a habit.</description>

      <description>We need a paradigm, paradigm is the way you see something, your point of view. Paradigms need to be principle-centered
   Be Proactive
 Proactive is the opposite of reactive. They are the one who have the control over your attitude. They make choices based on values. They think before they act. They recognize that they can’t control everything that happens to them, but they can control what they do about it.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The simple truth is that the brute force techniques used by most students are incredibly inefficient.&amp;rdquo; - Cal Newport
   Study in focused, but short blocks rather than pseudo-working through the night.
 Find your ideal study length. (50 minutes with 10 minutes rests, 30-5) Manage the time in daily calendar that can be updated so you can strictly follow it.    Find your most common excuses with a work progress journal</description>

      <description>”We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act, but a habit.” - Aristotle
 “The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.”
 Habits = Freedom: “Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.” Systems &amp;gt; Goals: “My results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.</description>
