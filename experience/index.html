My tasks consist of helping students in weekly labs, marking students' assignments, and tutoring students in 11 different computer science classes in the help center.\n Organization Experience  Lead Web Developer at SFUIA (Aug. 2022 - Present) I am the lead web developer at SFU Indonesian Organization where I spearheaded the website from the ground up. We used Next.js, Bootstrap, SASS, and Contentful as the tools to create this website. See more at Projects\n  Vice Lead at Google DSC Langara College (Jul. 2021 - Apr. 2022) We hosted several events about topics related to software development to Langara Students.\n Courses Note: Langara (Fall 2020 - Spring 2022), SFU (Summer 2022 - Present)\nFall 2020\n APSC 1010 - Engineering and Technology in Society Learned about history of engineerings, discussion of ethics, proposal writing and a final project of a line follower robot in Python\n  APSC 1050 - Process, Form, and Convention in Professional Genres Mostly about writing stuff in different essay type\n  MATH 1175 - Calculus I with Applications to Life Sciences Calc 1 with Life Sci is` just calculating size of cells instead of other non-bio things.\n  Spring 2021\n MATH 1271 - Calculus II Calc 2. I find it quite harder than calc 1.\n  CPSC 1050 - Introduction to Computer Science Similar like Harvard CS50 but easier. Introduction to all things in cs from a very high-level point of view (programming, networking, assembly, number systems)\n  CPSC 1150 - Program Design Introduction to programming in Java. Cover all basic things and JavaFX until recursion.\n  STAT 1181 - Descriptive and Elementary Inferential Statistics Introduction to statistics. Quite easy as we mostly just use formulas calculator and no fancy derivation/ integration.\n  BIOL 1115 - General Biology I All things first-year biology. Interesting but will never try again :)).\n  Summer 2021\n PSYC 1215 - Introduction to Social, Personality, and Abnormal Psychology Social Psychology. Really interesting to come across many concepts and biases that I have never realized\n  CPSC 1160 - Algorithms and Data Structures I First exposure to C++. Learned a lot of recursions, big o notation, bitwise operations, and linked lists\n  CPSC 1181 - Object-oriented Computing OOP in Java. Also learned more about JavaFX, networking, and multithreading\n  ENGL 1107 - Language and Composition Just your standard english writing course\n  MATH 2362 - Linear Algebra Just playing with vectors and matrices\n  Fall 2021\n CPSC 2150 - Algorithms and Data Structures II My most favourite course in Langara. Learned about linked lists, binary trees, stacks, queues, more big-o, and graph theory. Assignment is really lengthy but has a lot of tests (which is why I really liked it)\n  CPSC 2190 - Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science Discrete Math, which is also my favourite math course (Counting, Proofs, etc)\n  ENGL 1123 - Introduction to Academic Writing More english writing.\n  PSYC 1115 - Introduction to Biological, Cognitive, and Developmental Psychology Biological Psychology. Not as interesting as the social one but I enjoyed the “how to learn” chapter\n  Spring 2022\n CPSC 2130 - Multimedia and Animation Learned about web audio and animation with Javascript and Three.js. Also my first exposure to 3 adobe tools (Photoshop, Audition, and Premiere Pro)\n  CPSC 2221 - Database Systems Databases! This course covers mostly about relational databases and relational algebra. We used MySQL and MSSQL.\n  STAT 2281 - Probability and Elementary Mathematical Statistics Quite tragic. STAT 1181 is the easiest math/stat course I have ever taken while this one is the hardest. Though I can say I learned a lot about discrete and continuous probability.\n  ENGL 1130 - Modern Novel, Poetry, and Movie I find this english course to be more unconventional but interesting. My last paper is about analyzing Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away.\n  TA CPSC 1045 and 1155 Taught students JavaScript (1045) and C++ (1155).\n  Summer 2022\n CMPT 295 - Computer Systems Learned RISC-V Assembly. Opened my mind in how low-level languages looks like. It’s good for exposure, but not something I will be interested to dive deeply.\n  CMPT 276 - Introduction to Software Engineering Full-stack website group project. Created an amusement park website with Node.js, Express, PostgresQL, Stripe API and deployed with Heroku.\n  CMPT 213 - Object Oriented Design in Java First-half was very similar with the ones I have taken at Langara. The latter part teaches us Java Swing and Spring. Project is about making the package deliveries tracker with MVC architecture.\n  EDUC 100W - Selected Questions and Issues in Education Writing mostly about our positionality in the society. Discussed a lot about privileges, racism, and Indigenous reconciliations\n  TA CPSC 1030, 1045, and 1155 Taught students HTML+CSS (1030), JavaScript (1045), and C++ (1155).\n  Fall 2022\n CMPT 300 - Operating Systems In progress   CMPT 371 - Networking I In progress   CMPT 383 - Comparative Programming Languages In progress   CMPT 272 - Web I - Client-side Web Development In progress   TA CPSC 1045 Taught students JavaScript   ",

<p>My most favourite course in Langara. Learned about linked lists, binary trees, stacks, queues, more big-o, and graph theory. Assignment is really lengthy but has a lot of tests (which is why I really liked it)</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>CPSC 2190 - Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science</summary>
<p>Discrete Math, which is also my favourite math course (Counting, Proofs, etc)</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>ENGL 1123 - Introduction to Academic Writing</summary>
<p>More english writing.</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>PSYC 1115 - Introduction to Biological, Cognitive, and Developmental Psychology</summary>
<p>Biological Psychology. Not as interesting as the social one but I enjoyed the &ldquo;how to learn&rdquo; chapter</p>
</details>
<br/>
<p><strong>Spring 2022</strong></p>
<details> <summary>CPSC 2130 - Multimedia and Animation</summary>
<p>Learned about web audio and animation with Javascript and Three.js. Also my first exposure to 3 adobe tools (Photoshop, Audition, and Premiere Pro)</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>CPSC 2221 - Database Systems</summary>
<p>Databases! This course covers mostly about relational databases and relational algebra. We used MySQL and MSSQL.</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>STAT 2281 - Probability and Elementary Mathematical Statistics</summary>
<p>Quite tragic. STAT 1181 is the easiest math/stat course I have ever taken while this one is the hardest. Though I can say I learned a lot about discrete and continuous probability.</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>ENGL 1130 - Modern Novel, Poetry, and Movie</summary>
<p>I find this english course to be more unconventional but interesting. My last paper is about analyzing Hayao Miyazaki&rsquo;s Spirited Away.</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>TA CPSC 1045 and 1155</summary>
<p>Taught students JavaScript (1045) and C++ (1155).</p>
</details>
<br/>
<p><strong>Summer 2022</strong></p>
<details> <summary>CMPT 295 - Computer Systems</summary>
<p>Learned RISC-V Assembly. Opened my mind in how low-level languages looks like. It&rsquo;s good for exposure, but not something I will be interested to dive deeply.</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>CMPT 276 - Introduction to Software Engineering</summary>
<p>Full-stack website group project. Created an
<a href="../projects/#parkland">amusement park website</a>
with Node.js, Express, PostgresQL, Stripe API and deployed with Heroku.</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>CMPT 213 - Object Oriented Design in Java</summary>
<p>First-half was very similar with the ones I have taken at Langara. The latter part teaches us Java Swing and Spring. Project is about making the <a href="../projects/#amazing-package-deliveries-tracker">package deliveries tracker</a>
with MVC architecture.</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>EDUC 100W - Selected Questions and Issues in Education</summary>
<p>Writing mostly about our positionality in the society. Discussed a lot about privileges, racism, and Indigenous reconciliations</p>
</details>
<details>  <summary>TA CPSC 1030, 1045, and 1155</summary>
<p>Taught students HTML+CSS (1030), JavaScript (1045), and C++ (1155).</p>
</details>
<br/>
<p><strong>Fall 2022</strong></p>
