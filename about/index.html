<p>I enjoy reading books. I have mostly read non-fiction books, but trying to explore other genres as well. Here is a list of books that I would recommend to others:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="../posts/atomichabits/">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear <br>
Such a good book that helps you to learn the significance of habit and somehow reading it is a bit addicting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../posts/straighta/">How to Become a Straight-A Student</a> by Cal Newport <br>
The title can sound cringy I know, but this book changed my perspective about studying. It has helped me to study effectively to enjoy life outside more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../posts/7habits/">7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens</a> by Sean Covey <br>
One of my first self-help books. It is based on the more popular book by the author&rsquo;s father. For me, the main lesson here is to always think win-win. The game of life is not as competitive as it seems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../posts/deepwork/">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport <br>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../posts/navalmanack">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</a> by Eric Jorgenson <br>
A high-concentration of knowledge in quite a short book. You will learn from Naval Ravikant and his lessons on money creation, philosophy, and happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything is F*cked Up by Mark Manson <br>
The book that helps me to become more honest and being more in control with my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes You Win - Sometimes You Learn by John C. Maxwell <br>
My first self-help book. In this book, it gives an insight on why losing is not necessarily bad and embracing it will make you to learn better.</p>
